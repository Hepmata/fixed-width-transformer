# Validators
This document details the design of each available validators.

Guide for contributors:
1. Always detail the required arguments and data type.
2. Explain the flow and purpose of each validator.
3. Validators should never contain for loops.
4. Before you write a Validator, check and see if there are similar validators first! You should contribute code to existing validator if it already has similar functionality instead of writing a new validator.

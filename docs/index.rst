Welcome to FixedWidth Transformer's documentation!
==================================================
FixedWidth Transformer is a flexible ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) framework
that aims to simplify the time required to process and push data.

Being a flexible framework, you can choose to do the full ETL or individual sections,
for example just extraction without transformation. or extraction and transformation without
loading to external sources.
